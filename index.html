            <h2>Brief About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Actually W.I.P (Work In Progress) but I'll post a brief.
                 So hi there, I'm Shaun! I studied in St. Francis Xaviers, Kanjurmarg (E).
                  I'm currently studying in St. Xavier's College, Bombay, as a Science Student.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm actually a quiet guy (introvert) and a deep thinker. 
                I'm passionate about science and history - not just learning them, but analyzing them.
                I love furry friends with pure heart and paws with sparks of sincerity :]
                Whether it's studying the mechanics of a tank or the structure of a meaningful life, I try to 
                approach it all with curiosity, clarity, and calm focus.
            </p>
